      Well, this is bittersweet... you're not a winner this
      time. The good news is, you can pull around and try
      again tomorrow or the next day or the next day! Every
      day is a new chance to win.

      <br />
      In the meantime, we would like to thank you for
      participating by giving this offer for the next time
      you need some road trip candy:
