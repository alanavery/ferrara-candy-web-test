        </p>
        <p>
          Once on the Website, enter your email address and accept the Promotion
          terms and conditions to enter the Promotion (“an Entry”). Upon
          successful completion of Entry, Promotion results will be displayed as
          winning or non-winning message. If you receive a winning message, you
          will be prompted to provide/confirm additional contact information in
          order to claim a prize. If you do not provide your contact information
          when prompted or within one (1) hour, the prize will be forfeited and
          may be awarded to an alternate. All potential winners are subject to
          verification before any prize will be considered awarded for the
          respective Entry Period. Administrator is responsible for the
          functionality of the Website and will be the official timekeeper,
          whose decisions are final regarding Entry and prize claim(s). If
          during any Entry Period a prize winner is not confirmed by 11:59:59 PM
          ET, the prize for that Entry Period will not be awarded. Limit one (1)
          Entry per person/email address per Entry Period. For the purposes of
          this Promotion, an Entry Period is defined as the twenty-four (24)
          hour time window between 12:00:01 AM ET and 11:59:59 PM ET. During
          each Promotion Period, Entries must be completed by 11:59:59 PM ET of
          each Entry Period. Any Entry using multiple/different email addresses,
          mailing addresses, identities, registrations and logins, or any other
          methods will void such Entry and that entrant may be disqualified. Use
          of any robotic, repetitive, programmed, automated or computer system
          to participate online is prohibited and will result in
          disqualification. Normal message/phone/Internet access and data/usage
          charges imposed by your online/phone service may apply. All on-screen
          wins are subject to verification. Receipt of Entry may be
          acknowledged, but such acknowledgment does not constitute any
          representation as to eligibility. Entrants must have a valid email
          address.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. VERIFICATION/WINNER NOTIFICATION: All winners are subject to
          confirmation, verification of eligibility by Administrator and
          compliance with these Official Rules in Sponsor’s sole discretion. For
          each Entry Period, once a potential winner has been determined, a
          message will be posted on the Website stating as such and no more
          Entries will be accepted for that respective Entry Period. If the
          potential winner cannot be verified within one (1) hour from initial
          notification, the Website will reopen until a winner is confirmed for
          the respective Entry Period or until 11:59:59 PM ET; whichever occurs
          first. All material submitted becomes the sole property of the Sponsor
          and will not be acknowledged or returned. Return of Promotion messages
          or notification as undeliverable may result in disqualification and
          alternate selection. In the event that a potential Promotion winner is
          disqualified for any reason or if due to an error of any kind, more
          winning names are determined as instant winners, or more instant win
          prizes are claimed than are intended to be awarded, the intended
          instant win prize(s) will be awarded in a random drawing from among
          all verified instant win prize claims received (odds of such drawing
          will depend upon the number of eligible entrants). In no event will
          the Sponsor be obligated to award more than the stated number of
          prizes. Verified winners will have their prize either emailed or
          mailed to the address provided at the time of prize claim within 4-6
          weeks, as applicable. Return of any prize as undeliverable will result
          in disqualification and forfeiture of prize. Potential winners are
          subject to verification by Sponsor and/or Sponsor’s designated agents,
          whose decisions are final and BINDING IN ALL MATTERS RELATED TO THE
          PROMOTION. Sponsor is not responsible for any change of email address,
          mailing address and/or telephone number of entrants. Sponsor is not
          responsible for any prize shipment that is damaged, lost, stolen,
          delayed, or otherwise impacted in transit or upon delivery.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. PRIZES AND APPROXIMATE RETAIL VALUES (“ARV”): There will be one (1)
          prize awarded per Entry Period during the Promotion Period. Prizes are
          randomly time-seeded each Entry Period, throughout the Promotion
          Period and awarded to the entrant who plays on or after the time the
          prize is randomly seeded. Odds of winning depend on the number of
          eligible Entries received and the order in which such Entries are
          received. See complete list of Entry Periods and Promotion prizes
          below. Total ARV of all prizes: $4,705.00. Any unclaimed prizes will
          not be awarded. Prizes are nontransferable, non-assignable, and no
          substitution or cash redemption is allowed, except that Sponsor
          reserves the right to award an alternate prize of equal or greater
          value if advertised prize becomes unavailable. The ARV of any prize
          listed is subject to price fluctuations in the consumer marketplace
          based on, among other things, any gap in time between the date the ARV
          is estimated for purposes of these Official Rules, and the date the
          prize is awarded or redeemed. If the actual purchase price of a prize
          is less than the ARV stated herein, the prize winner will NOT be
          entitled to a check, cash or other form of payment for the price
          difference. Separate e-gift card terms and conditions apply as set by
          issuer. Winners are responsible for all taxes relating to the prize,
          if applicable. Limit One (1) prize per person per Promotion Week and
          three (3) prizes per person for the entire Promotion Period. For the
          purposes of this Promotion a (“Promotion Week”) is defined as Monday
          12:00:01 AM ET through Sunday 11:59:59 PM ET except for the first
          Promotion Week which will be Friday, 3/15/24 through Sunday, 3/17/24
          and the last Promotion Week will be Monday, 9/30/24 12:00:01 AM

          prior to cancellation and the remaining prizes will go unawarded.
